It follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to ensure maintainability, scalability, and reusability of test code.

ðŸš€ Key Features
    1.Page Object Model (POM) design for structured and maintainable code.

    2.Reusable Utilities & Helper Functions for common actions like waits, element interactions, and validations.

    3.Custom Logging using Log4j for better debugging and execution tracking.

    4.Automated Reporting with Extent Reports for visually rich test execution results.

    5.Screenshot Capture on Failures to assist in quick defect analysis.

    6.Configurable Execution via Maven command:
